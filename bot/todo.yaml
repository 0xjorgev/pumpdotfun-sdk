- EC2:
  - Have a permanent IP address

- BUG: when a timeout occurs during subscription, the next step is
       BUY and should be unsubscribe to token.

- BUG: When token is too old, It should  hear again from redisdb
       Now is continuing the steps.



- Fees service:
  - Create a service that will subscribe to
  sniper pubkey and get any changes in its state
  and log it in redis.
    - Create a new index for this

- Scanner: 
  * will delete all tokens -> is_checked == False
  -> Work with black list and discard any token made by blacked developers

- Docker: run automatically
- Bash: apply command arguments to choose
  how to run the celebrimborg: Sniper, messaging
  - Send messsages when things goes wrong

- Replace prints with Logging with timestamp
